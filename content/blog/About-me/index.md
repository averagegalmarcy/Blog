I am a budding JavaScript developer that has a passion for food, dogs, and napping! I created this blog to detail my experience as a complete newbie in the coding world.

Some quick things about me!

* I dream of having a cream colored french bulldog name Cheddar!
* I graduated with a Political Science degree because I thought I wanted to be an attorney... boy I am I glad I changed careers. 
* I have a fear of open and vast waters...
* I can't stand asparagus, its gross.
* My favorite food is soup, pho specifically.
* I am originally from Austin, TX. Keep Austin Weird!
