Wow! The first week was rough.

## What Happened?
The first day was totally fine, we did HTML and CSS which was something that I was already pretty comfortable with but after that day, wow was it hard. I am not used to doing many things for 8 hours straight, 5 days a week, so coming to this school and being in an area that I am not super familiar with was much harder than I thought. We dived into Javascript and started creating functions, event listeners, large if statements etc. The learning curve was really high and after the second day, I was so mentally exhausted. The only thing that I could compare it to was the times when I do international flights and after the flight your struggling to get to your hotel and you're in a new environment so everything just goes through one ear and out the other. We also had a weekend lab that we did which was a partner lab where we created a Guess or Hang game. After coding for 40+ hours and then spending another 5 hours over the weekend with a group coding, it was just so much. I am exhausted just thinking about it. Overall, I am glad that this week is over. Hoping that this gets easier.
