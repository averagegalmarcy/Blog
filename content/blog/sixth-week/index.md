## SQL, REST, and JSON?

This week was my first taste of the backend! We used the SWAPI to get details of all the characters of Star Wars. We also dived into our first SQL database with was postgres in order to set up databases to store user information. Finally, we executed our first CRUD app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete goals! This week was a doozey! A lot to get through, but I really enjoyed the full-stack process. It was satisfying to create a database such as dogs, render the dogs on our app, and have the user be able to add their own dog and or delete a dog in order to really curate their dog collection!

The backend wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. It was pretty straight forward, and postgres was intuitive to me, but the docs weren't very unhelpful, so I was pretty happy to have an instructor that was available to help with aggregations. As for hooking up an API with a front-end framework, that process also was smoother than I thought it would be. I am really excited to see what more there is with the backend!

### Goals App
This app has both a frontend and backend. Users can login/sign-up and add a goal to their list of goals with a date. Once a goal is completed, users can mark it complete. Users are not able to see other user's data, due to Authentication/Tokens and postgres which store user's info.
