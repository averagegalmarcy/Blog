## Another hard week, but it's getting better.

This week was better. Still difficult, but I think my brain is finally able to catch up to the pace. We created a to-do list, created a Pokedex with huge pokemon database that we manually had in our app. We also created an Event Registration site that allowed you to fill out a form and save the information to local storage. Another really packed week, but at least it was as bad as the first week. I am excited to see how far I have come within just two weeks! Looking forward to next week.
