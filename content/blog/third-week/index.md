## Third Week! Not too bad!
So the third week has ended! It's been going pretty well. I learned how to use arrow function, classes, as well as component architecture. We did do this one lab that was based off of a like a SkyMall catalog where the user could pick an item out of three and do this for a total of 27 times and then the site would render the user input via a Chart. This allowed the "admin" to see what product was the most selected by the user. This one was pretty tricky, it took about 3 days and some people still haven't finished. Mine turned out fine, it it perfect no, but I think I did a pretty good job.I do think it's import to work on a project for more than one day because it teaches you patience and shows you that there will be times when you are sick of project but you have to see it through. You can't just drop it. 

## First Final Project Week is Looming...
We are headed into the first finals week for BootCamp 1. I am pretty nervous because its a group project. We get free rein on what we do our project on but it does have to satisfy some requirements. Wish me luck.
