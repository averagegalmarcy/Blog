A little bit about my background. I graduated with a BA in Political Science and even went through the Department Honors Program. Right after graduating, I landed a job at a law firm that specialized in Marijuana Law, so that was really interesting. However, as I worked there, I wasn't very keen on the work that I was doing nor the work that my attorneys were doing. If anything, law seemed to be all paper work and rules, with very little else. I know that there is much more to law, but I just couldn't see myself being happy in that profession. After leaving the firm after a year, I went into couple other jobs that were fine, but definitely not my "career" jobs. As fortune would have it, I met a mutual friend who happened to be a software developer that went through a code camp and even received a grant to attend that school. After poking around some code camps in Portland, teaching myself some code (basic HTML and CSS), and applying for the grant, I knew that this was something that I could see myself long term. So here were are!  

## Why a Code School?

I choose a code school because I already had a college degree and I knew that I didn't want to spend 4 more years pursuing a CS degree. That was a lot of money and time and I just didn't have. So a code school was something that I gravitated towards naturally. How I choose my school was an amalgamation of many different factors. Here were a few:

- The cost of the program 
- Location of the school
- Curriculum
- The application process
- The instructors
- General reputation

So after accessing all these factors, I finally landed on the one that I wanted. No code school is perfect, but it is really important to ask a ton of questions about the curriculum, graduation and retention rates, as well as the success of the students once they leave. I wasn't looking for a diploma mill, I wanted to learn a skill that would carry me through this next chapter of my life. Highly recommend doing your research and just asking tech companies around you what coding schools they would recommend.

## Job Security and Opportunities

We've all heard it. Tech is notorious for the money and the opportunities for growth. I am not going to sugar coat it, this was definitely a factor in why I am here. In my city, tech jobs are plenty, however, for people with mid-to-senior experience. Juniors are a dime a dozen, so getting the first job can be very hard. However, what I have come to really enjoy about this industry is how fast paced things are and that there is always more you can learn and do. I don't think you could get bored with it very quickly.

## Room for Growth

This factor has quickly become something that I experience more and more. I love to learn, always have, and being in this type of work allows you to always feel that you are continually growing your skills and abilities. You don't even have to be an official course or school to feel this way, the amount of information on the internet is insane. That access to information is your best friend!
